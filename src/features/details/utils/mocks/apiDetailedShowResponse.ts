    "summary": "<p>The Downton Abbey estate stands a splendid example of confidence and mettle, its family enduring for generations and its staff a well-oiled machine of propriety. But change is afoot at Downton--change far surpassing the new electric lights and telephone. A crisis of inheritance threatens to displace the resident Crawley family, in spite of the best efforts of the noble and compassionate Earl, Robert Crawley; his American heiress wife, Cora his comically implacable, opinionated mother, Violet and his beautiful, eldest daughter, Mary, intent on charting her own course. Reluctantly, the family is forced to welcome its heir apparent, the self-made and proudly modern Matthew Crawley himself none too happy about the new arrangements. As Matthew's bristly relationship with Mary begins to crackle with electricity, hope for the future of Downton's dynasty takes shape. But when petty jealousies and ambitions grow among the family and the staff, scheming and secrets--both delicious and dangerous--threaten to derail the scramble to preserve Downton Abbey. <i>Downton Abbey</i> offers a spot-on portrait of a vanishing way of life.</p>",

Violet wants her support in the dispute over the hospital, and explains that her reason for opposing the merger is her resentment at the government taking over more and more things instead of leaving it to the locals, which rather mollifies Isobel. Lady Rosamund also visits, and is visited by Mr and Mrs Harding in connection with a women's college of which she is a trustee. Mrs Harding turns out to be Gwen, the former housemaid who left to better herself; the family are pleased for her. Sergeant Willis asks Miss Baxter to testify against the man with whom she was involved when she stole from a previous employer; she is afraid, but Molesley encourages her, and she agrees. Daisy is upset when she learns that Mr Mason is unlikely to get Yew Tree Farm, and prepares to angrily confront Cora, but she has persuaded Robert and Mary to let him have the farm, which fortunately Daisy learns before risking her job by being rude.Anna has pains, and is rushed to London by Mary, where the doctor performs the promised operation and saves the baby. Once home, Bates has guessed the problem, and is delighted Anna is pregnant. Robert keeps getting twinges of pain, but insists it's nothing. Mary meets Henry in London, and tells him that his making a pass won't work. Mr Carson and his wife, still to be known as Mrs Hughes, arrive back from their Scarborough honeymoon and move into a cottage. Edith announces she plans to appoint a woman editor to her magazine.</p>",

A suspicious Violet goes to confront Amelia, and accuses her of wanting Isobel to marry Lord Merton and look after him in his old age. The family watch Henry in a motor car race, but his friend Charlie is killed in a crash. With the entire family in shock, Mary takes a call from Henry, who implores her to give her an answer to his advances; she says no, as he is not the right type for her.

Mrs Hughes pretends to have injured her hand, so is unable to cook, and gets Mr Carson to do everything; naturally he makes a complete mess, and gains a new respect for his wife's efforts. Mrs Patmore's B&amp;B opens with its first guests. Bertie proposes to Edith, who asks for time to consider. Upon returning to Downton, the family are surprised to learn Violet is going away for a month to the south of France, in an effort to clear the air following the conflict over the hospital. She does make one gesture of goodwill before leaving, a new dog for Robert.</p>",
